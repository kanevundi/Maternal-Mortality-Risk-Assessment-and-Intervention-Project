## Introduction

This project focuses on a comprehensive data that includes significant risk factors such as age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood sugar levels, body temperature, and heart rate, all of which can influence a woman's risk of maternal mortality. The dataset can be found  [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/863/maternal+health+risk). The ultimate goal is to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk level faced by pregnant women and to identify the most influential factors contributing to maternal mortality.

By using advanced data analysis and machine learning, this project seeks to provide valuable insights into maternal mortality risk, enabling healthcare providers and policymakers to implement targeted interventions and policies that can effectively reduce maternal mortality rates and contribute to the achievement of the UN's SDGs. This project not only sheds light on the risk factors but also serves as a tool for creating evidence-based strategies to protect the lives of expectant mothers worldwide.

Maternal mortality remains a pressing global health concern, with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) emphasizing its reduction as a key priority. The "Maternal Mortality Risk Assessment and Intervention Project" aims to address this critical issue by leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques to better understand and predict the risk factors associated with maternal mortality.
